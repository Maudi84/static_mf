I am a recent graduate at UC Santa Cruz with a B.S in Computer Science. I am also a newly enrolled student in the M.S Computer Science program at UC Santa Cruz.

I have recently acquired two exciting positions since I've graduated. The first is a QA Analyst position for a company called Verisk. I am currently working with an app called Respond which is a web app that provides natural disaster information and claims data for insurance companies. My job is to setup automated testing suites for various projects at Verisk and ensure that the APIs are working properly, and to also track down and help fix bugs in the code.

The second position is a teaching assistant position for a Web Development course at UC Santa Cruz. I hold section lectures as well as office hours to help students understand concepts, track down bugs, and set up their environments for the different projects they have to complete. The students are currently learning to develop in JavaScript and will soon begin their first full stack application in React and Node.

I am forever interested in all things web development, database, and distributed system related. These are likely the topics I'll be focusing my research on.

In the future I intend to earn my Master's Degree and eventually take on more responsibility professionally as a full fledged developer.
