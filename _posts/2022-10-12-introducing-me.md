title: My Introduction
---

Hi my name is Maurice. I am a software professional and a hardware enthusiast. I've created this website because I have recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a B.S in Computer Science and needed a way to showcase my projects, experience, and skills. I am a big advocate and forever student of web development, databases, and distributed systems.

I am also currently enrolled in the Master's of Computer Science program at UC Santa Cruz and may possibly be posting research projects here in the near future as well.

If you are a prospective employer, please take a moment to review my resume, take a look at my GitHub projects, and please reach out if you have anymore questions.

Thanks!
