title: Finally Made
---

You would think that someone who spent a good part of their lives developing websites from scratch and getting involved in full stack web development would have a website. Well, here it finally is in all it's glory.

The truth is I've been very busy finishing school, leet code grinding, interviewing, and now working my new job. 

All it took was a little free time and some serious academic pressure from one of my teachers.

If you are prospective employer, please have a look around at any of my projects, resume, or LinkedIn.
