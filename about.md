I am a recent graduate at UC Santa Cruz with a B.S in Computer Science. I am also a newly enrolled student in the M.S Computer Science program at UC Santa Cruz.

I have recently acquired two exciting position since I've graduated. The first is a QA Analyst position for a company called Verisk. I am currently working with an app named Respond which is a web app that provides natural disaster information and claims data for insurance companies. My job is to setup automated testing suites for various projects at Verisk, including Respond and to also track down and help solve various bugs in the code.

The second position is a teaching assistance position for a Web Development course at UC Santa Cruz. I hold section lectures as well as office hours to help students understand concepts and track down bugs for the different projects they have to complete. I never intended on teaching, but finding that I am quite enjoying it and the students seem to appreciate it also.
